# **Kaggle-Competitions**

## **Competition 1 (Analysing Titanic Survival)**
### **In this competition the goal is to predict the titanic survival. First I have analyze the data, then secondly I have clean the data, visualize the data and then normalize the data and pally machine learning algorithms.I have also used K-fold technique to check which Algorithm is giving best accuracy. So, in this project I have used the following machine learning models:**
### **1. Logistic Regression**
### **2. Super Vector Machine**
### **3. Perceptron**
### **4. SGDClassifier**
### **5. Random Forest Classifier**
### **6. KNeighbors Classifier**
### **7. Decision Tree Classifier**
### **8. Linear SVC**
### **9. Naive Bayes**
### **10. CatBoost**
