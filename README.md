# **Kaggle-Competitions**

## **Competition 1 (Analysing Titanic Survival)**
### **In this competition the goal is to predict the titanic survival. First I have analyze the data, then secondly I have clean the data, visualize the data and then normalize the data and apply machine learning unsupervised algorithms because it is a classification problem. I have also used K-fold technique to check which Algorithm is giving best accuracy. So, in this project I have used the following machine learning models:**
### **1. Logistic Regression**
### **2. Super Vector Machine**
### **3. Perceptron**
### **4. SGDClassifier**
### **5. Random Forest Classifier**
### **6. KNeighbors Classifier**
### **7. Decision Tree Classifier**
### **8. Linear SVC**
### **9. Naive Bayes**
### **10. CatBoost**

## **Competition 2 (House Price Prediction)**
### **In this project the goal is to predict the houses price. First I have analyze the data, then then secondly I have clean the data, visualize the data and then normalize the data and apply machine learning supervised algorithms because it is the regression problem. I have also used cross validation score for selecting the best model. So, in this project. I have used the following machine learning models:**
### **1. Decision Tree Regressor**
### **2. Random Forest Regressor**
### **3. XGBoost Regressor**

## **Competition 3 (Predict Future Sales)**
### **The task is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set. Note that the list of shops and products slightly changes every month. Creating a robust model that can handle such situations is part of the challenge. So, in this project. I have used the following machine learning model:**
### **1. XGBoost Regressor**
